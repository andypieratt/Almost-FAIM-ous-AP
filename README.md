# Almost-FAIM-ous: Bringing back that sweet IM nostalgia

# Description

```md
Do you contantly find yourself being overwhelmed with today's social media? Are you dreaming of a simpler time? Well 'take a chill pill' because that's why we developed Almost-Faim-ous. Our app allows the user to revisit the greatest era for instant messaging, the mid 90s to early 2000s. Almost-Faim-ous gives the user a 'fly' way to stay intouch with friends. Just sign up and you'll be directed to a live chat where you can get the '411' from your friends and stay connected with others who think the past was 'da bomb.'
